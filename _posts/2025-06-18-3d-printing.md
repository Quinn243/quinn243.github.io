As a hobbyist and aspiring researcher, I've been diving into the world of open source robotics. I'm particularly fascinated by how 3D printing can bring digital designs to life â€” making it possible to quickly iterate, test, and learn through physical interaction.

Below are two recent components I printed using my desktop FDM printer:

### LeRobot Arm Follower
